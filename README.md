* Extra Credit: 45 pts

## Crowdsourcing a "cheat" sheet

Over the course of the semester, we've helped G. Wiz tackle a large number of issues, and (along the way) learned far too many concepts for a single individual to count. But, as in the past when G. Wiz has needed a quick solution to his problems, he's turned to you as a class to come up with unique solutions to help him through whatever his current conundrum is. Perhaps we can help him through one last issue.

As you know, G. Wiz could only hide from the tax authorities for so long. However, he's convinced them that if he can provide some evidence of having completed a community-focused service, they might just overlook his frivolous spree..._once_.

Here's where you come in: in your project groups, for one last "hurrah!", G. Wiz would like you to summarize all of the knowledge that you've gained over the course of the semester bit-by-bit, tackling small pieces as a class to come together and create a complete guide as a whole. This benefits not only you as a good opportunity to remind yourself of key concepts, but also your fellow students who plan to take them exam or would like a handy list of `Java` basics for the future. In any event, complete the assignment to recieve extra credit for everyone in your group!

## Topic distribution

As commented, the sheer number of topics might be too great for one person alone. To separate and divide the labor:
